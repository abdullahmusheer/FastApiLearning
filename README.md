# FastApiLearning
In this I learned about FastAPI - a cool python frameworks for building Rest APIs and then used different ways to expose data to the web for external users..
I have always been fascinated of how APIs were developed eversince I started working as a data analyst and consumed data from different sources to add to my datalake and reports.
Now working in Infrastructure ..I have understood so much more on services and ports and the way things work ...
In this repository I do the following:
1. Start off from the basic syntaxes for fastApi 
2. Connect to a local database (setup locally) from where I will attempt to share data to the external public
3. Create different endpoints
4. Use different ways to expose the app :
  a. using ngrok (free version)
  b. Serverless computing on AWS using EC2

stay tuned
